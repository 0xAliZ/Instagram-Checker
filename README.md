# Instagram Username Checker

**A program that checks the availability of Instagram usernames.**  
It uses a list of proxies to avoid bans or other issues during the checking process.

### Requirements
- **Python 3**
- Libraries: `requests` and `tkinter` (usually included by default on many systems)
- A text file with usernames (one per line)
- A text file with proxies supporting HTTPS , HTTPS (one per line)

### How to Use
1. Click **Load Usernames** to select the file containing the usernames.
2. Click **Load Proxies** to select the file containing the proxies.
3. Configure **Threads**, **Delay**, and **Max Retries** as desired.
4. Click **Start** to begin the checking process.
5. Once the process finishes, click **Save Lists** to save the list of available usernames.

### Important Notes
- It is recommended to use high-quality, reliable proxies. Weak proxies may cause connection errors.
The script can use a proxy list in the format IP:Port or IP:Port:User:Pass.
- If a specific proxy is blocked or fails to connect, the program will switch to another proxy or retry until the maximum retries limit is reached.
- Note: This script is old and may be updated in the future to add new features or improve performance.
